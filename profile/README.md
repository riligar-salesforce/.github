# RiLiGar - Salesforce

> Real Software Engineering for Your CRM.

Your Salesforce org is a critical business platform, not a place for quick fixes. We aren't just Salesforce developers‚Äîwe are **software engineers who specialize in Salesforce**.

We transform your CRM with clean, testable, and scalable code, backed by over 20 years of software engineering expertise.

## üéØ Why RiLiGar? The Engineering Factor.

We apply enterprise-grade software engineering practices to the Salesforce ecosystem. This means:

‚úÖ **Clean & Scalable Code**
No more technical debt. We build solutions that grow with your business, are easy to maintain, and respect Governor Limits.

‚úÖ **Modern DevOps (SFDX, CI/CD)**
We use a source-driven development flow with Git, Scratch Orgs, and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions / Jenkins) for fast, reliable deployments.

‚úÖ **Testing as a Priority**
We guarantee 95%+ Apex code coverage and robust LWC unit testing (Jest). Your code works‚Äîand keeps working.

‚úÖ **Software Architecture**
We don't just jump into code. We design solutions that are performant, secure, and aligned with platform best practices.
